# Description
SMPL will be compiled down to C, which is then again compiled down to machine code by clang.
This project has not been finished yet and won't be supporting OOP until the language is capable of doing tasks using the FP paradigm.
# Goal
SMPL aims to be as simple as possible, much like C but with more type-safety and other safety features.
# Example Code
``` C++
// Function definition describes a function with
// two parameters of type i32, and should also return
// a value of type i32
defn pow(base: i32, exp: i32) -> i32 {
    // Range-based for loop
    let result: i32 = 1;
    for i in 0..exp {
        result *= base;
    }

    return result;
}

// Entry function `main`
defn main() {
    // Assigns x to 12 as type i32 (signed 32-bit integer)
    let x: i32 = 12;
    let y: i32 = 14;
    let z: i32 = x + y;

    let w: i32 = pow(z, 2);
}
```
# Progress
- üü° Lexical analysis is partially done. The compiler for now will output the lexeme and its token kind representation.
- ‚ùå Syntax analysis (parsing)
- ‚ùå Type inference(?)

# Primitive Types
An integer's name caan be composed of its signedness and its bit-width. For example, i32 means it is a signed 32-bit integer and u32 means it is an unsigned 32-bit integer.
Floating-point types are also named this way, without the signedness.

**Here are the primitive types for SMPL:**
- i8
- u8
- i16
- u16
- i32
- u32
- i64
- u64
- int (signed integer with a bit-width that depends on your machine's architecture)
- uint (unsigned integer with a bit-width that depends on the architecture, primarily used for array indexing)
- f16
- f32
- f64
- f128
# Composite types
**SMPL composite types will be composed of:**
- Class
- Arrays
- Lists (Dynamic Arrays)
- Hashmaps
- Strings
- Enums
# Prerequisites
- clang (or any C++23 compiler)
- C++23
# Build
To build, simply compile all the source file with a -Iinclude option (also, don't forget the standard version) (e.g. `g++ src/**/*.cpp -o smpl -Iinclude std=c++23`).
# Run
Run the executable with the command 
```
./<executable> source_file.spl
```
